# Molecular-Dynamics-Molecular-Cages
> Data analysis methods and part of the raw data for the paper "Supramolecular Proton Conductors Self-Assembled by Organic Cages".

## Methods
The analysis methods are described in the `md_ana.ipynb` file.

## Results
The analysis results are available in the cage1 and cage2 folders.

## Raw data
The raw `.xyz` trajectory files are several hundreds of MB. Part of the trajectory files (50000 AIMD steps, 5000 frames) have been uploaded into the cage1 and cage2 folders. The raw trajectory files can be offered in reasonable request to reproduce our results.
