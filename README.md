# Molecular-Dynamics-Molecular-Cages
> AIMD data analysis methods and part of the raw data for the paper "Supramolecular Proton Conductors Self-Assembled by Organic Cages".

## Methods
The analysis methods are described in the [md_ana.ipynb](https://github.com/Lei-Lei-alpha/Molecular-Dynamics-Molecular-Cages/blob/main/md_ana.ipynb) file.

## Results
The analysis results are available in the cage1 and cage2 folders. The files in the above folders are:
- `sys-pos-1.xyz` the AIMD raw trajectory file generated by CP2K code run on Archer2.
- `cage*_500K.xyz` the trajectory file calibrated by fix the centre of mass of the system.
- `water_com_cage*.xlsx` the centre of masses of water molecules
- `MSD_D_H2O_cage*.xlsx` the mean square displacements and diffusion coefficients of water molecules.
- `hbonds_mic.json` the hydrogen bond analysis results, including the number of H-bonds in each frame, the donor, acceptor, the donor-acceptor separation, the D-H&middot;&middot;&middot;A angle. For cage-2, only 3000 frames are included due to file size limit.
- Figures:
  - Average MSD and diffusion coefficient with error bounds.

## Raw data
The trajectory was dumped for every 5 fs (every 10 AIMD steps), and the raw `.xyz` trajectory files are large (several hundreds of MB). Part of the raw trajectory data (650 frames, the time interval between two consecutive frames is 5 fs) have been uploaded to the cage1 and cage2 folders. For our analysis, all frames (over 11,000 frames, > 55,000 fs or 55 ps) in the large raw trajectory files were used. The raw trajectory files can be provided in reasonable request to reproduce our results.
